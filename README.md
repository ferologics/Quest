Quest
=====

A RPG game project from CartoonSmart tutorials.

This is my project that I've been working on lately, feel free to check it out, its not finished yet..
Its build in SpriteKit framework, sorry for code beauty, I'm still a newb-ish noob :D ...

For now it has just basic methods like folow, turn left, right, up, down, plus
some animations and later on I'll add particles, enemies, etc...
