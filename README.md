Quest
=====

A RPG game project from CartoonSmart tutorials. (You are so awesome)

Sure consider to buy something at cartoonsmart.com cause they supply with very gr8 lectures for
wide audience. 

This is my project that I've been working on lately, feel free to check it out, its not finished yet..
Its build in SpriteKit framework, sorry for code beauty, I'm still a newb-ish noob :D ...

For now it has just basic methods like folow, turn left, right, up, down, plus
some animations, particles, and few othe gestures... later on I'll add enemies, etc...

This game works on iPad AND iPhone (universal).

Feel free to fork!
